                    Cepi is a MMORPG Minecraft Server that takes place in a vast 
                    fantasy world filled with magic and never before seen wonders.
                    Cepi's Development is different than many other projects similar 
                    to them because they do not use bukkit or any forks, and they have 
                    plans to become open source. The Development Team contains many talented 
                    individuals who have learned a lot and continue to grow while 
                    working on this project.
                </p>
                <p class="lead1">
                    I joined the Cepi team in February 2021, and I applied because I wanted to learn 
                    newer tooling such as Kotlin and Gradle. I was also interested in a new 
                    Minecraft API known as Minestom, which they were using. I had a lot to learn,
                    but the team was amazing and helped me through setting up and my first project.
                    I made new friends and gained new skills for the future.
                </p>
                <p class="lead1">
                    Among my work for the MMORPG, I helped develop the server's 
                    <a href="https://cepi.world/" target="_blank">website</a> and also 
                    worked on multiple plugins for the server such as a movement extension 
                    that would allow players to enable special abilities such as double 
                    jumping, gliding, a speed boost, and more. I was already great at algorithms 
                    but I had yet to learn optimization techniques, and Cepi can run lag-free 
                    with 7000+ people on the server at one time.

                    GhostDelta is a Minecraft server started by ghostt and his friends, 
                    with a Towny like survival up along with Skyblock and Creative plots.
                    At the moment, they also have Prison in progress. This is a smaller 
                    server than Cepi, but was crucial for helping me get accustomed to 
                    learning how to work in a team and in a more professional environment.
                </p>
                <p class="lead2">
                    I joined GhostDelta in January 2021, as a Developer and moderator for the 
                    <a href="https://discord.gg/CztyaZ3" target="_blank">discord</a> and Minecraft server. I had experience with Spigot/Bukkit plugins, 
                    but since the server was a Bungee server, I had to learn about the new API 
                    and gained experience in learning as I developed. I configured multiple 
                    plugins for the server such as an NPC GUI plugin and some commands plugins.
                </p>
                <p class="lead2">
                    My moderator work consisted of interviewing new applicants, enforcing rules 
                    in the discord and Minecraft server, and helping to grow the GhostDelta community. 
                    As of now, there have been over 80 people who have played on the server, even in 
                    its development stages. Currently I am assisting the team with the development of 
                    the Prison section of the server.

                    Even though I'm an introvert and a nerd, I really love helping people. Whenever my 
                    classmates ask for help, particularly in math and computer science, I enjoy 
                    explaining the concepts and assisting with studying for tests. In this way, I reinforce 
                    my own knowledge of the subject while at the same time forging new relationships and 
                    helping others.
                </p>
                <p class="lead1">
                    After a while, I began joining my favorite creators' discord servers and just spending some 
                    time every day in their homework help channels, where people in the community flocked to recieve 
                    help that they might not have access to at home. I cheerfully helped with a plethora of subjects,
                    mainly Algebra and Geometry. I made new friends from across the country with a common interest 
                    and gained experience in helping people without being able to physically talk to them.
                </p>
                <p class="lead1">
                    In addition to the unofficial tutoring I gave to my classmates and fellow server members, 
                    I also hosted a small two-week summer camp for my brother and some of his friends that introduced them 
                    to the basics of Java, including Strings, loops, writing methods, and simple algorithms. 
                    I happily taught them for free, but I still recieved some tips from their parents thanking me 
                    for my work.
