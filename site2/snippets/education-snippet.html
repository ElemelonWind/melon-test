        I'm currently attending Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, which
        is a selective governor's school in the Fairfax County Public School system. It offers
        exclusive advanced courses for computer science, as well as other fields such as biology
        and chemistry. In their senior year, students are required to participate in a graduate school 
        type research lab, and I am planning to choose either the Computer Systems lab or the 
        Mobile/Web App Development lab.
    </p>
    <p class="lead1">
        Previously, I have taken Foundations of Computer Science, where I learned the founding
        principles of coding. Currently I am taking Advanced Placement Computer Science A and 
        Data Structures, which have deepened my understanding of how I can use object-oriented 
        languages to my advantage to code magnificent things such as simulations and advanced 
        recursive methods.
    </p>
    <p class="lead1">
        In the future, I am planning on taking Artificial Intelligence 1 and 2, Web App Development,
        Mobile App Development, Machine Learning 1 and 2, Computer Vision 1 and 2, and perhaps Parallel
        Computing as well. In addition, I am taking AP Calculus BC, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear
        or Matrix Algebra in the coming years. I will graduate and recieve my advanced studies diploma
        in June 2023.

        Summer Camps & Self-Study

        I've attended numerous summer camps that have enhanced my computer science skills, including
        an Introduction to Computer Science course, which was my first experience with "real" coding.
        I've also taken Minecraft modding camps, Scratch camps, and others when I was younger that
        provided me with a foundation and love for the subject.
    </p>
    <p class="lead2">
        In addition, I have learnt many skills using only YouTube tutorials or other resources I've
        found online. For example, I taught myself how to code Minecraft plugins using Spigot/Bukkit API,
        make discord bots using Discord.js API, and even how to make this very website using a HTML5,
        CSS3, and Twitter Bootstrap coursera course that I discovered.
    </p>
    <p class="lead2">
        This summer I hope to delve into 
        Python algorithms and Unity game development with the C# 
        coding language. In the future, I also 
        want to learn languages such as C++ for mobile game development.
        Finally, I wish to develop my own card game web interface and a
        productivity app within the next few years, possibly for my senior 
        research project.
