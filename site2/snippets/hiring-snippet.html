        I'm open for hiring for website design, tutoring, Minecraft plugins, and discord bot commissions!
        I'm also glad to take collabs for any projects you'd like to work on with me. In addition, if you 
        just want to talk with a fellow cs nerd, about books, music, video games, or literally anything, feel free 
        to contact me! I love making new friends :)

    <p class="lead1">
        My preferred contact is either through <a href="mailto:c.yang.2023@gmail.com">email</a> or through 
        discord - you can add me at ElemelonWind#6881. You can also check the footer of the website for my 
        other socials, if you'd prefer to contact me through Facebook or Instagram. I usually reply within 
        24 hours, and if I don't you may resend the message.
