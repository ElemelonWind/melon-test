                Heyyo! My gaming username is ElemelonWind, but you can 
                call me Melon. I'm an enthusiastic but noob gamer
                who tryhards every game I happen to get obsessed with.
                I just like to enjoy my time playing video games with my
                friends, even though I happen to lose. A lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I don't like many games, I really get into the
                ones I play. Here is a list of the games I took pretty
                seriously.

            <p>Username: <a href="https://www.starlist.pro/stats/profile/9RULVRLLU" class="linkmod2" title="stats" target="_blank">Derp Gal</a></p> <!--Add profile info link-->
            <!--Also add profile links for minis and clubs!-->
            <p>I got into Brawl Stars at the end of 8th grade because
                literally ALL of my friends played it, even the ones
                who didn't really like video games. I downloaded it 
                because I was super bored and found out it was pretty 
                fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite gamemode is showdown because the only
                objective is to survive, which has some interesting
                gameplay. Even though sometimes that means teaming
                or bush-camping. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite brawlers are Sprout, Pam, Penny, Jessie,
                and Edgar. Each has unique mechanics/personality and
                some are just plain adorable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created a bunch of alt accounts for less
                stressful gameplay. My main mini is DerpGal2.0, and 
                some other random minis I had are SparklingKiwi, 
                ShiningAngel, and SMH.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined my friend's club, the New Order, for a while
                before moving to AE Nebula, where I spent the rest of
                my active days. When I stopped playing as often I was
                kicked and I moved to a new club called Born4Mayhem,
                but it started dying so I just moved to AE Vague.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the trophy reset update, I was almost at 18k
                trophies, but afterwards I was set back down to 16k.
                I kind of lost motivation after that and my sporadic
                sessions faded to complete inactivity.

                Username: <a href="https://plancke.io/hypixel/player/stats/ElemelonWind#BedWars" class="linkmod2" title="stats" target="_blank">ElemelonWind</a>
            </p>
            <img class="wrapText" src="download (3).png" width="25%">
            <p>
                On Minecraft, I mainly play Hypixel Bedwars. I
                occasionally also play Duels, and rarely play 
                Skywars, Murder Mystery, and Skyblock. Also, I 
                sometimes go on my discord server's realm and 
                my SMP, as well as my friends' SMPs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got into Minecraft after years laying dormant on 
                my computer. My brother introduced me to the Dream Team,
                and from there I rediscovered the mcyt community, which
                led to me being interested in survival multiplayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I mostly play bedwars. I've always loved watching
                bedwars, and for some reason it never occurred to me that 
                I could actually play it. So I started playing a bit and 
                really fell in love with the game. Sure, I raged a bit.
                Sure, I'm really, REALLY bad. But it's fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I main triples, because there are teammates to carry
                me but not too many people in the game. There are also
                less teams, so it's easier to win. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to only defend the base and camp diamonds, but 
                that never got me any wins. I finally learned to
                ninja bridge correctly and started taking risks and 
                rushing others. It led to way more fun and intense
                gameplay even though sometimes I would throw the game
                by being too aggressive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I slowly started improving at pvp and I also found
                a few friends that I could play with sometimes. I don't
                play as much anymore, but I still consider myself
                active on the server.

            <p>
                I started playing Among Us when popular streamers such
                as Pokimane, Valkyrae, and Corpse started blowing up.
                I played with friends and made new friends, but it just
                got kind of repetitive after a while, so I stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
                I loved playing as impostor, even though it was super
                stressful. My favorite map is Polus because it's an
                open map so it's harder for crewmates to catch the
                impostors and they actually have to think.

                I'm not *super* active on twitter, I mainly just quote 
                tweet things I want to react to and follow dttwt, tiredtwt, 
                sbitwt, and other groups.

            <p>
                I'm probably the most active on discord, if you dm me there 
                I usually reply in a few hours at most (no guarantees if I 
                don't like you though)
            </p>
            <p>
                I also own a decent-sized discord server for chatting and gaming. It's not
                the most active place (~100 msgs/day) but at least that means you won't be 
                spammed ;)

                But those are either contain private information about me or I just don't 
                have any content on so yeah B)
