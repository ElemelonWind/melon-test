                Heyyo! My gaming username is ElemelonWind, but you can 
                call me Melon. I'm an enthusiastic but noob gamer
                who tryhards every game I happen to get obsessed with.
                I just like to enjoy my time playing video games with my
                friends, even though I happen to lose. A lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I don't like many games, I really get into the
                ones I play. Here is a list of the games I took pretty
                seriously.

            <p>I got into Brawl Stars at the end of 8th grade because
                literally ALL of my friends played it, even the ones
                who didn't really like video games. I downloaded it 
                because I was super bored and found out it was pretty 
                fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite gamemode is showdown because the only
                objective is to survive, which has some interesting
                gameplay. Even though sometimes that means teaming
                or bush-camping. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite brawlers are Sprout, Pam, Penny, Jessie,
                and Edgar. Each has unique mechanics/personality and
                some are just plain adorable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created a bunch of alt accounts for less
                stressful gameplay. My main mini is DerpGal2.0, and 
                some other random minis I had are SparklingKiwi, 
                ShiningAngel, and SMH.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined my friend's club, the New Order, for a while
                before moving to AE Nebula, where I spent the rest of
                my active days. When I stopped playing as often I was
                kicked and I moved to a new club called Mayhem4Life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the trophy reset update, I was almost at 18k
                trophies, but afterwards I was set back down to 16k.
                I kind of lost motivation after that and my sporadic
                sessions faded to complete inactivity.

            <p>
                On Minecraft, I mainly play Hypixel Bedwars. I
                occasionally also play Duels, and rarely play 
                Skywars, Murder Mystery, and Skyblock. Also, I 
                sometimes go on my discord server's realm and 
                my SMP, as well as my friends' SMPs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got into Minecraft after years laying dormant on 
                my computer. My brother introduced me to the Dream Team,
                and from there I rediscovered the mcyt community, which
                led to me being interested in survival multiplayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I mostly play bedwars. I've always loved watching
                bedwars, and for some reason it never occurred to me that 
                I could actually play it. So I started playing a bit and 
                really fell in love with the game. Sure, I raged a bit.
                Sure, I'm really, REALLY bad. But it's fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I main triples, because there are teammates to carry
                me but not too many people in the game. There are also
                less teams, so it's easier to win. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I used to only defend the base and camp diamonds, but 
                that never got me any wins. I finally learned to
                ninja bridge correctly and started taking risks and 
                rushing others. It led to way more fun and intense
                gameplay even though sometimes I would throw the game
                by being too aggressive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I slowly started improving at pvp and I also found
                a few friends that I could play with sometimes. I don't
                play as much anymore, but I still consider myself
                active on the server.
